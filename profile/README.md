# [Semi-Decent](https://www.semidecent.com/)
## All software sucks. What we build is Semi-Decent.
We are a software consultancy that ships software quickly.
To accomplish this, we do a couple things differently:
We work in 6 week blocks and guarantee a deliverable at the end of each block. If you need us for a larger project, you can book multiple blocks, but we plan each block as if it were a completely separate project with its own deliverable.

We offer a 100% money back guarantee. If you aren't satisfied with our work at the end of a block, you can get all of your money back for that block and you never have to see us again.

We have none of the overhead of a traditional engineering organization. Once we've finalized requirements for a project, we put our heads down and get to work. This means we iterate more quickly and get vastly more work done than the average dev team.
